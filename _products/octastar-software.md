## ***<span style="color: #ff6600;">Introducing the OctaStar Software</span>***

From **Four Stars-ES** comes the OctaStar software: the latest generation of Flying Probe Software for the Micronic Innovation Series test systems. Introduced in Winter 2022, this software has been redesigned for twenty eight axis, eight head control in both dual image and single image modes.

- Kelvin and Embedded Component Test Support
- 1000 Volt and 10 Giga Ohm Isolation Test Support.
- HiPot Testing
- Extended alignment and test functionality for specialized manufacturing processes.
- Extended error reporting and printout options.
- Work Order Based test reporting and statistic gathering.
- MES (Manufacturing Execution System) support.
