## <span style="color: #ff6347;">***Universal Measuring Device (UMD)***</span>

#### The UMD is a universal measuring device for use in Flying Probe Testers for PCBs.

The functional targets are comparable to those of the measuring electronics used in the earlier MANIA Ultim8 testers; however the UMD is completely new developed to achieve highest performance.

The UMD is perfectly driven and controlled by the FourStars-ES ProbeStar Software.

#### **The main functions of the UMD are:**

- Capacitance measurement
- Resistance measurement, supporting 
    - Regular 2 wire continuity measurements.
    - Four wire Kelvin low resistance measurements.
    - Four wire Kelvin component measurements.

#### **The UMD consists of 2 electronic parts:**

- An analog electronic module
- A digital electronic module

#### **The analog module contains:**

- Power connector for single 24V DC supply
- Local voltage regulators
- References
- Analog components (converters, amplifiers, etc. )
- Interface to the measuring probes (Hirose PO6 coax connectors)  
    max. cable length to contacting probes: 8 m each

#### **The digital module contains:**

- Interface to the controlling PC
- High speed (Xilinx) FPGA for real time data processing of measurement data
- Integrated soft cores for smart data handling and process control
- Diagnosis display

#### **Mechanical Solution:**

- Sandwich solution for easy integration into different tester types
- Assembled and tested at FourStarsES
