In order to handle product with minimal edge clearance, FSES has worked with partner Micronic Enterprise Co., Ltd. to implement a compression solution that fits easily into the stretch frame.

Switching between Compression and Stretch Modes is fast and easy and allows for handling of square product having down to 1mm space on the vertical edges.
