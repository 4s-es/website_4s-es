FSES Engineer Seth Sheades recently returned from another extended visit to Micronic facilities in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. During this visit, his first to Mainland China since 2019, he worked intensively with our partners from Shenzhen Micronic Technology Co. Ltd. addressing points with the ProbeStar and OctaStar software packages. This was another fruitful visit advancing the performance of all Micronic Test Systems.

From May 24-26 he also visited the HKPCA Show in Shenzhen where he met with customers, partners and even some old colleagues.
