FSES Engineer Seth Sheades recently returned from a three month visit to the Micronic office in Hong Kong. He spent this time there with Mak Waitung and Tony Wong performing an intensive OctaStar Software Integration in the Innovation System and providing real time training and evaluation of the complete system.

The trip was very successful and all anticipate great success in the future!
